In this lab the students were required to use Verilog to construct and implement both structural and behavioural models for different kinds of adders. The first kind of adder was a ripple carry adder. Ripple carry adders are constructed by cascading full adders with the carry output of each adder being used as the carry input of the next adder. The second kind of adder was a carry look ahead adder. A carry look ahead adder is a different kind of adder that avoids the delays of the ripple carry by using more complex hardware to achieve a degree of parallelism.
